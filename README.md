<h1># Proyect-of-Caceres</h1>
<p> This is my first c++ eclipse's proyect at the university in which I worked with data structures. 
  </p>

<h2> Proyect : </h2>
  <p> This is a <strong><BIG> Software </BIG></strong>  based on  organize data's files <I>(.csv)</I>  such as streets, neighborhoods and bars in <strong> Data Structures </strong>. Data structures implemented are Lists, Queues, and BST (Binary Search Tree) . There is a menu inside the software which may be used by the user to access different operations.</p>
<p> You can look below the menu translated in english with his certain keys (keyboard) : </p>

 <uL>
        <li>   1. Show all streets that are been part of a particular neighborhoods </li>
          <li> 2. Show the longest street in Caceres </li> 
            <li> 3. Show Caceres's bars which serve a particular kind of food </li>
              <li> 4. Create a text file in which all bars are ordered in the opposite  alphabetical  order </li> 
                <li> 5. Create a text file with bars from a particular street given the full name </li>
                  <li> 6. Show a particular bar and the name of the street where the bar is located </li> 
                    <li> 7. Show bars naming with a given root in order by capacity </li> 
                      <li> 8. Show bars that serve a particular kind of food and their capacity above a new one given </li>
                        <li> 9. Show the neighborhoods that has more bars and create a new text file with all of them </li>
                          <li> f. Get out of the program </li>
